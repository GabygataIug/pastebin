  <h3>Scripts and Editor Integration</h3>
  <p>
    For some popular editors lodgeit integration scripts/plugins exist.
    Additionally there is also a small script that allows pasting from the
    command line.
  </p>
  <h3>Command Line Script</h3>
  <p>
    The usage is pretty simple, to paste a file use the following command
  </p>
  <pre class="sample">lodgeit.py /path/to/file</pre>
  <p>
    This will use various guessing methods to get the correct language of
    the file. If all guessing fails it falls back to a normal text paste.
    You can also provide the language yourself.
  </p>
  <pre class="sample">lodgeit.py -l LANGUAGE /path/to/file</pre>
  <p>
    For a list of supported languages use the following command:
  </p>
  <pre class="sample">lodgeit.py --languages</pre>
  <p>If no file is given it will read from the standard input stream.</p>

  </p>
  <h3>Vim Support</h3>
  <p>
    If Vim is your editor you can paste and download pastes directly from
    within Vim.
  </p>
  <p>
    All you have to do to paste the current range or whole buffer to lodgeit
    is executing <tt>:Lodgeit</tt>. If you want you can map this command to
    a mapping like ctrl+p by adding this to your vimrc:
  </p>
  <pre class="sample">map ^P :Lodgeit&lt;CR&gt;</pre>
  <p>(^P is entered using ctrl + v, ctrl + in vim)</p>
  <p>
    If you want to reply to a paste from within Vim you can call
    <tt>:Lodgeit PASTE_URL</tt> or <tt>:Lodgeit #PASTE_ID</tt> and load the
    paste into a new tab. After modifing it you can push the new version to
    the server using <tt>:Lodgeit</tt>.
  </p>

  </p>
  <h3>Emacs Support</h3>
  <p>
    You need a working installation of <a href="http://pymacs.progiciels-bpi.ca/">Pymacs</a>.
    For Linux users, many distributions already include a package; otherwise, refer to the
    <a href="http://pymacs.progiciels-bpi.ca/manual/Installation.html#Installation">Pymacs documentation</a>
    for help. If Pymacs is working, you just need to put <tt>paste.py</tt> into a directory where
    Pymacs can find it (see the variable <tt>pymacs-load-path</tt>), and add the line
    <tt>(pymacs-load "paste")</tt> to your <tt>.emacs</tt> file. If you want a Pastebin menu in
    your menu bar, you also need to add the line <tt>(paste-menu)</tt>.
  </p>
